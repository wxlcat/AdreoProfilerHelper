# AdreoProfilerHelper
this is a tools for andreo profiler

Usualy, we use adreo profiler to hack the art resource of android game. Such as textures and obj models.
But, the textures need to be rotated and mirrored. The obj models could not be recognized by unity, we need to remove all ‘#’ in the obj model file.
So the AdreoProfilerHelper is designed to do this automatically.

Setup.py is used to make exe file in windows.
ModifyObj.py is main file.
